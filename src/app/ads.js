/* Advertising, provider-agnostic.
 *
 * Which network serves these slots is not settled - AdSense, Media.net and Newor Media
 * all want different tags - but everything that matters to this site is identical
 * whichever wins: where the slots sit, that they reserve their height, that they are
 * labelled, and that nothing loads off-origin during development. So the provider is
 * one setting and an adapter, and the rest of the file never changes.
 *
 * Three rules this module exists to enforce, because getting any of them wrong costs
 * either money or the product:
 *
 * 1. Nothing loads off-origin unless we are actually on the deployed host. The charter
 *    pins zero runtime dependencies and `file://` support, so local development, the
 *    browser suites and anyone who cloned the repo get no third-party script at all.
 * 2. Every slot reserves its height in CSS before the frame arrives. An ad that pushes
 *    the page down as it loads is a layout shift, and layout shift is the one Core Web
 *    Vital a static site can still fail.
 * 3. IDs live here, once. Hunting a stale publisher ID through five HTML files is how
 *    one of them ends up wrong.

  /* Monetag, as an In-Page Push (Banner) zone.
     That format was chosen out of the seven Monetag offer because it is the only one
     that neither hijacks a click nor covers the page. Onclick (Popunder) and MultiTag
     (which bundles Onclick) fire on any click, and this site's entire interaction is
     clicking and dragging to trace an outline. Vignette and Interstitial are overlays
     that would land on top of the instrument. Push Notifications prompt for a browser
     subscription.
     Unlike the other three providers here the push zone is NOT slot-based: one zone
     covers the whole site, and Monetag's own tag appends itself to <body> and positions
     its banner itself rather than filling a container. The reserved ad frames are filled
     by a second zone, the Direct Link, described below.

     scriptSrc and zone are duplicated in the inline head snippet of all five HTML pages,
     which is what actually loads that tag; they are kept here so `ready()` can tell a
     configured provider from an unconfigured one, and so there is still one documented
     place recording which zone the site runs. If the zone ever changes, change it in the
     pages - those two fields alone do not load anything.

     `directLink` is the second zone, and it is the only one of Monetag's seven formats
     that can fill a container: their own description is "place the Direct Link in any
     element of your website: banners, buttons, and text". So it is what occupies the
     page's reserved ad frames, which In-Page Push cannot do. It pays per click rather
     than per impression, which is also why it is safe to sit in a footer: nothing fires
     unless a visitor deliberately chooses it, so it cannot interrupt a drag on the
     plate the way Onclick or a Vignette would. */

     off-origin loaded into the page, no iframe - which is why it costs nothing in layout
