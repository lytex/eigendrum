# Eigendrum: everything is a drum

**Draw a shape. Hear the sound it would actually make.**

![The Eigendrum interface: a circular drum ringing after a strike, with the mixture of modes it excited listed beside it and the solver's own measurements below](docs/hero.png)

Eigendrum treats whatever you draw as an ideal drumhead clamped at its rim, solves
the Laplacian eigenvalue problem on that exact region using real finite elements,
and synthesises the frequencies it finds. Nothing is sampled and no overtone is
faked: draw a circle and the overtones come out as ratios of Bessel function
zeros, because that's what a circular drum actually does.

Then it lets you hit it. Strike different places and the timbre changes, because
striking a spot drives each mode in proportion to how much that mode moves
there. Hit a line where a mode stands still and you cannot excite it at all.

You can also watch it: the real vibration modes ripple across the shape, with pale
channels along the curves where the surface never moves. Those are nodal lines, the
mathematical ancestors of the sand figures Ernst Chladni was drawing in 1787.

No dependencies, no build step, no backend. Clone it and open `index.html`, or:

```bash
npm run serve     # http://localhost:8080
npm test          # 57 tests, including the accuracy proofs below
```

## What you can do with it

- Click or tap the plate to strike it anywhere. Where you hit changes the timbre,
  and the readout names the loudest mode along with any that stayed silent because
  the mallet landed on their nodal line.
- Press any row in the mode list to hear that one mode by itself. No mallet can do
  that, since a real strike always wakes many modes at once, but it is the only way
  to hear what a single eigenvalue sounds like, and it is what makes the mixture
  legible afterwards.
- Draw your own outline, or pick from eleven built-in forms, including both halves
  of the isospectral pair.
- Write the outline as an equation instead: `r(t)` in polar, or a parametric
  `x(t), y(t)` pair, with `t` sweeping one full turn. This reaches shapes a hand
  cannot trace accurately, like eleven even lobes or a superellipse partway between
  a circle and a square, and it makes a shape something you can *vary*: change one
  number and hear what moved. Expressions are parsed, never evaluated as JavaScript,
  because a formula arriving from somebody else's link is untrusted input.
- Move the parts that aren't fixed by the outline. The pitch reference and ring-out
  are yours. Mallet width changes how local the strike is, and which modes it
  reaches. The overtone *ratios* stay tied to the outline.
- Watch the mesh the solver actually used, flexing with the membrane.
- Copy a link that carries the shape in the URL fragment, save the strike as a
  `.wav`, or the plate as a `.png`. A formula travels as the formula
  (`#f=p:1 + 0.3cos(5t)`), so the link is readable, editable in the address bar, and
  survives any later change to how curves are sampled.
- Use it from the keyboard. Tab to the plate and press Enter or Space to strike it
  at the marked point. Every form, mode and control is reachable and labelled,
  contrast meets WCAG AA, and `prefers-reduced-motion` holds the peak displacement
  instead of animating.

Your shape never leaves your browser. It lives in the URL fragment, which browsers
never send to a server, and the site's analytics only logs which page you're on,
never what you drew. There's no backend: meshing, solving, and audio all happen on
your machine. A local clone or the GitHub Pages mirror doesn't load analytics or
ads at all.

## Writing a shape as an equation

`t` runs from 0 to `tau` in radians, one full turn. Every outline gets scaled to
unit area before solving, so size doesn't matter: what you hear is the shape, not
the size, and `r = 0.001` and `r = 5000` are the same drum.

| notation | meaning | example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| polar | `r(t)`, the radius at angle `t` | `1 + 0.3cos(5t)` |
| parametric | `x(t)`, `y(t)` | `3cos(t) - cos(3t)`, `3sin(t) - sin(3t)` |

Operators are `+ - * / % ^` with the usual precedence, `^` right associative.
Brackets group, `|x|` is absolute value, and implicit multiplication is accepted, so
`2t`, `3cos(t)` and `2(1 + t)` all mean what they look like.

Available: `pi tau e phi`, and `sin cos tan asin acos atan atan2 sinh cosh tanh exp
log ln log2 log10 sqrt cbrt abs sign floor ceil round hypot pow mod min max clamp`,
plus `square` and `tri`, a square wave and a triangle wave of period `tau`, which is
how you get teeth and facets without a piecewise notation.

Three kinds of formula are refused rather than answered, and each says which it is:

- one that has no value somewhere on the sweep,
- one whose curve crosses itself, since a crossing outline has no interior to solve
  on (a negative `r` is the usual cause, and it is named as such),
- one too thin to mesh honestly. A hair-thin sliver has no interior nodes across its
  narrow direction, so it would come back with numbers, and they would be wrong.

An implicit form `F(x, y) = 0` is deliberately absent. It needs contour tracing and a
rule for which contour you meant, which is a different job from parsing an expression.

Expressions are compiled by a recursive-descent parser in `src/math/expr.js`, never
by `eval` or `new Function`. That is not stylistic: shapes travel in the URL
fragment, so an expression is untrusted input arriving from a link somebody else
wrote, and handing that to a JavaScript evaluator would make every shared drum a
script-injection vector.

## Can one hear the shape of a drum?

Mark Kac asked exactly that in [a famous 1966 paper](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2313748).
If you know every frequency a drumhead can produce, can you deduce its outline?

In 1992 Carolyn Gordon, David Webb and Scott Wolpert answered **no**, by
constructing two different shapes with identical spectra. Both are built into
Eigendrum as *Kac drum I* and *Kac drum II*. Each is made from the same seven
right-isosceles triangles, rearranged. One looks like a hook and the other like an
arrow. They enclose the same area and the same perimeter, and **every single
frequency matches**.

![Kac drum I selected. A panel reports that both drums were solved just now and all 16 frequencies agree to within 1.0e-7 percent, and the frequency comb shows the partner drum's ticks above the axis landing on top of this drum's below it](docs/kac-pair.png)

Both drums are solved, and the app reports the agreement it measured rather than
asserting the theorem. The partner drum's spectrum is drawn above the same axis as
this one, so you can see the ticks coincide.

Switch between them and listen. This is not an approximation that happens to come
out close:

```
  k        drum I         drum II    difference
  1     2.54398772     2.54398772        0.00000%
  2     3.66297335     3.66297335        0.00000%
  3     5.19087452     5.19087452        0.00000%
 ...
 12    15.95243552    15.95243552        0.00000%
```

Both drums have only axis-aligned and 45-degree edges on integer coordinates, and
the mesher reproduces both of those directions *exactly*, so the two discrete
problems are isospectral in exact arithmetic too. Run it yourself:

```bash
node tools/isospectral.mjs
```

## The mathematics

A membrane clamped at its boundary can only vibrate in certain shapes at certain
frequencies. They are the solutions of

```
  −∇²u = λu   inside Ω,        u = 0   on ∂Ω
```

Each eigenfunction `u` is a standing wave; each eigenvalue `λ` gives a frequency
proportional to `√λ`. For almost every shape there is no formula, so Eigendrum
solves it numerically:

1. Mesh it: overlay a lattice of right-isosceles triangles, keep the triangles
   whose centroid is inside, project the resulting boundary onto the true
   outline, then repair it (slide boundary nodes along the outline to even out
   their spacing, drop the degenerate splinters that snapping leaves behind,
   smooth the interior).
2. Assemble it: P1 linear elements give the stiffness matrix `K` and the
   consistent mass matrix `M`. Dirichlet conditions are imposed by never
   assembling rows for boundary nodes.
3. Solve it: the lowest 16 eigenpairs of `Kφ = λMφ`, by block inverse iteration
   with a Rayleigh–Ritz projection. Inverse iteration because we want the
   *bottom* of the spectrum, and plain Lanczos converges to the top.
4. Listen to it: frequencies from `√λ`, per-mode amplitudes from projecting the
   mallet onto the mode shapes, then a sum of decaying sinusoids.

The step from projection to amplitude is where a struck membrane gets its voice,
and it is easy to get wrong. Three factors apply, and only the last is a choice:

- Mass normalisation. `c_k = ∫φ_k g` is the modal coefficient only when the
  modes are orthonormal in the mass inner product. The solver normalises them to
  unit *peak* instead, for the colour map's sake, so the projection is divided by
  `∫φ_k²`. That varies by a factor of about two across the first sixteen modes of
  a disk.
- The `1/ω_k` rolloff. A mallet delivers an impulse of *force*, which sets the
  membrane's initial velocity, not its displacement. Solving `u_k(0) = 0`,
  `u_k'(0) = a_k` gives `u_k(t) = (a_k/ω_k) sin ω_k t`, a 6 dB/octave rolloff.
- Contact time. No beater is an impulse. A force pulse lasting `T` cannot pump a
  mode whose period is far shorter than `T`, modelled here as a one-pole rolloff
  fixed at a ratio of the fundamental so the timbre does not shift with the pitch
  control.

Damping is **Rayleigh damping**, `C = αM + βK`, which is the standard proportional
model for a system like this one and in modal coordinates reads
`1/τ_k = α + βω_k²`. Loss growing with the *square* of frequency is why a drum's
high inharmonic partials vanish in tens of milliseconds while the fundamental
rings on, and that fast darkening is most of what makes a drum read as a pitched
thud rather than a chord. The brightness control moves weight between the two
terms.

The eigensolver needs a few hundred solves of `K y = b`, so `K` is reordered with
reverse Cuthill–McKee and factorised once with a banded Cholesky. After that each
solve is two triangular sweeps. A 2000-unknown drum solves in about 700 ms in a
browser worker.

## Accuracy

A handful of shapes have spectra that can be written in closed form, and the test
suite checks the solver against them on every change. This is measured, not
asserted: reproduce it with `npm run bench`.

| shape | exact spectrum | 1200 nodes | 2600 | 6000 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| unit square | `π²(m² + n²)` | 0.846% | 0.375% | 0.160% |
| rectangle 1.5 × 0.8 | `π²(m²/a² + n²/b²)` | 1.141% | 0.548% | 0.233% |
| right triangle | square modes with `m ≠ n` | 1.103% | 0.519% | 0.227% |
| unit disk | squared zeros of `J_m` | 0.946% | 0.437% | 0.192% |

Worst relative error over the lowest 8 modes. The errors fall in the ratio
1 : 0.47 : 0.21 against predicted `h²` ratios of 1 : 0.471 : 0.207, which is clean
second-order convergence.

Two further checks worth naming:

- Every error is positive. A conforming finite element method minimises the
  Rayleigh quotient over a subspace of the true space, so it can never
  undershoot. An eigenvalue below the exact one would mean a bug, not a coarse
  mesh, and the suite asserts it never happens.
- The strike model reproduces physics nobody coded in. Striking a circle dead
  centre excites the radially symmetric fundamental hard but leaves the next two
  modes essentially silent, because they have a nodal diameter straight through
  the centre. That falls out of the projection, and it is a test.

## What's physics and what's just a knob

This matters because it tells you which parts of the sound come from the outline
and which are settings.

The shape decides the frequency ratios, the mode shapes, and which modes a given
strike position can wake up. It also decides where the fundamental sits relative
to the pitch slider: every shape gets scaled to the same area before solving, so
whatever's left in lambda_1 is genuinely about the shape rather than its size.
That swings by about six semitones across the built-in presets, and by
Faber-Krahn's inequality the disk always comes out lowest: a round drum really is
the deepest drum for its area. None of this is adjustable, because none of it
should be.

What you do get to touch: the wave speed `c = sqrt(T / rho)` (tension and
density), which the pitch slider sets by naming the note a unit-area disk would
ring at. Every other shape then lands above or below that on its own, so the
slider is a reference point, not a promise about what you'll hear. You also
control how fast the overtones fade (material and air).

The mallet sits outside both categories: its width is a control, its contact
time is fixed, and it only changes how much of each mode a strike can reach,
never what frequency that mode rings at.

## Layout

```
index.html    the whole page: shell markup, the About dialog, and the head's
              canonical tag, social cards and JSON-LD. No application logic
robots.txt    crawl directives, answer engines allowed on purpose
sitemap.xml   one URL, because shapes travel in the fragment and fragments are
              not separate resources
llms.txt      a plain-prose summary for answer engines, with the measured
              accuracy figures and the Kac story
styles/       all styling, plus the typeface as a base64 data URI
src/math/     linalg, sparse CSR, banded Cholesky + RCM, eigensolver, Bessel,
              closed-form spectra, the expression parser
src/geom/     polygon utilities, the mesher, equations to outlines
src/fem/      P1 assembly, and the pipeline that ties it together
src/audio/    modal synthesis, WAV encoding, note naming
src/app/      DOM, canvas rendering, input, presets, sharing
src/worker/   runs the mesher and solver off the main thread
tools/        dev server, accuracy bench, isospectral check, browser smoke tests
tests/        node --test
docs/         the images this README embeds
```

`src/math`, `src/geom` and `src/fem` never touch the DOM, which is why they can be
tested in Node and run in a worker. The worker owns every expensive step, so the
interface stays responsive while a drum solves.

The typeface is embedded as a data URI rather than linked, because Chrome refuses
font subresources over `file://` and this has to work from a bare filesystem.

## Working on it

```bash
npm run serve   # dev server on :8080
npm test        # unit tests, including the accuracy proofs
```

Puppeteer is a dev dependency, used only by the browser tests, and never loads in
the browser. The shipped app has zero runtime packages: every application module and local asset
resolves inside this repo. On the deployed Vercel site, the two first-party Vercel telemetry
scripts load from the platform endpoints.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the rest of the scripts (accuracy
benchmarks, the isospectral check, browser smoke tests) and how advertising is
wired up on the deployed site.

## Deploying

Copy the repo to any static host. There is no build step, no server-side anything,
and no environment to configure. GitHub Pages, Netlify, S3, a USB stick.

The canonical host is `eigendrum.com`. `index.html` declares
`<link rel="canonical">` pointing there, and `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml` and
`llms.txt` all name it. That matters because the repo still deploys to GitHub Pages
as well: the redirect off `baselashraf81.github.io/eigendrum` is written in
JavaScript, which no crawler that skips scripts will ever run, so without the
canonical tag the two hosts compete as duplicates and neither earns the credit. If
you fork this to your own domain, change the host in those four places.

## The visitor and presence counts

Two real numbers in the footer, both hidden until they resolve rather than shown
as placeholders, and both only run on the deployed host.

- Visits since launch is an aggregate page-load count stored in Cloudflare D1.
  Each production page load increments it once through `/api/visit`;
  `/api/visits` reads the current total. It stores no cookie, IP address, or
  browser identifier, so it counts visits rather than unique people. If the
  database is unavailable, the footer stays hidden instead of showing a
  made-up number.
- People here right now comes from a completely separate WebSocket server in
  `presence-server/`, deployed on its own VPS rather than on Cloudflare Pages,
  because counting concurrent connections needs a persistent process. See
  `presence-server/README.md` for how it is deployed and wired up. If that
  server goes down, the count just disappears from the footer; the rest of the
  site does not depend on it.
